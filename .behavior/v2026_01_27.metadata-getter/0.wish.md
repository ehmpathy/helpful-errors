wish =

we were able to access the error.metadata via attribute

while it still not serializing redundantly on stringification

---

could we use a getter for that?


---

e.g.,

BrainNotFoundError extends HelpfulError<{ options: { repl: string[], atom: string[] }}> {}

where HelpfulError now has HelpfulError<TMetadata> generic (backwards compat)

and
const error = new BrainNotFoundError('not found', { options: { repl: ['a', 'b'], atom: [] } })
error.metadata.options.repl // has type string[] via typescript


---

we should be able to use postiive and negative ts-expect-errorss to prove that the TMetadata generic constraints both the metadata input on the error as well as the metadata output access on instantiated error

---

everything must be backwards compat still
