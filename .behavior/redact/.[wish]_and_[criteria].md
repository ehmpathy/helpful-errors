# wish

ability to `error.redact(['metadata'])` from an error

why?

in some cases, we only want the message to be retained


# criteria

given(a HelpfulError)
  when(someone calls the public static .redact() method on it)
    then(it returns a clone of itself)
    then(the only difference in the clone is that it strips the metadata out of the message)
