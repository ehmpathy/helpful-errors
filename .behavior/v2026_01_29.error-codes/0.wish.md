would be awesome if it was easy to declare error codes per error

both, custom slugs

as well as http

e.g.,

error.code.{ slug?: string, http?: number }

---

by default, helpful error has code.http undefined

but BadRequestError is a 400 error

and UnexpectedCodepathError is a 500 error

---

also, should be easy for users to supply

code: { slug }

via the metadata/options input

similar to how easily they're able to supply 'cause'

---

also, code should be extractable

and extensible to be baked in on every subclass

so that if someone wants to create an

```ts
AuthorizationError extends BadRequestError {
  code = { slug: "AUTHZ", http: 403 }
}
```

then they could
